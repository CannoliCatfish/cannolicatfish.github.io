Welcome to the website for **Project Rankine**, a mod for (currently) Minecraft 1.16.5!

This website will be used to post useful information regarding our mod in the [wiki](https://cannolicatfish.github.io/docs/home) as well as keep those interested up-to-date with our progress with the **blog**.
Information and showcases will still likely also be posted at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/EBtSqDN). If you haven't joined yet, please do! We have a wonderful community that can help out if you have any questions about the mod or simply want to discuss any aspect of it.

We have plenty of things still left in store for Project Rankine. We hope you enjoy our mod, whether you are a newcomer or someone who has been playing our mod for a while!
