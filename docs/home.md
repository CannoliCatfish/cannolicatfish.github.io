Welcome to the **Project Rankine** wiki!

This wiki will cover various topics of the mod, ranging from mechanics to specific machines that can be used. Typically, the information provided by this wiki will go more in-depth than what is found in the Patchouli book, and may also provide visual aid for certain topics.

Information regarding gameplay features and progression can also be found using the in-game Patchouli guidebook. We also support JEI and are more than happy to help with anything regarding the mod on our discord.

The main goal of the **Developer Wiki** is to assist players in modifying Project Rankine in various ways. This includes custom machine jsons, config settings, and other ways to support compatibility with other mods.


This wiki is a work-in-progress and will be updated periodically with new information.
