Welcome to the **Project Rankine** wiki!

The main goal of this wiki is to assist players in modifying Project Rankine in various ways. This includes custom machine jsons, config settings, and other ways to support compatibility with other mods.

Information regarding gameplay features and progression can be found using the Patchouli guidebook, JEI and information on our discord.

This wiki is a work-in-progress and will be updated periodically with new information.
